## 0. Brand Logo — Primary Wordmark + Icon

```
Design a professional logo for "Move to Digital" — an independent automation and integration architecture practice. The practice builds secure bridges between enterprise systems. The logo needs personality and warmth while remaining professional.

CONCEPT — "The Stamped M":
The logomark is a warm terracotta ROUNDED SQUARE (like a modern app icon shape with smooth corners) with the letter "M" CUT OUT of it in negative space — the M is white (the background showing through), and the surrounding shape is filled solid terracotta. Think of it as a rubber stamp or a wax seal: a warm, solid shape with a clean letter pressed into it.

This approach gives the logo personality because:
- The filled shape creates a warm, confident presence (unlike an outline or bare letterform)
- The negative-space cutout technique feels crafted and intentional — like a maker's mark
- The rounded square container reads as modern and app-aware (your audience knows this shape)
- It's inherently distinctive — most logos are positive-space marks, this is inverted

EXACT CONSTRUCTION:
- The outer shape is a ROUNDED SQUARE (also called a squircle). Proportions: exactly square. Corner radius: approximately 22-25% of the width — smooth, continuous corners like an iOS app icon, NOT a basic rounded rectangle with circular arcs
- The outer shape is filled SOLID with Primary Terracotta (#C2714F) — completely flat, no texture, no gradient
- The "M" inside is cut out as NEGATIVE SPACE (white/transparent showing through)
- The M letterform should be a clean, geometric sans-serif — similar to the "M" from Plus Jakarta Sans ExtraBold or Montserrat Black
- The M should be optically centred within the square (slightly above mathematical centre)
- The M should occupy approximately 50-55% of the square's width and 45-50% of its height
- The M's strokes should be THICK and confident — this is a bold, heavy letterform
- The M has sharp, straight edges — no serif details, no decorative features
- Small, even spacing between the M's edges and the outer shape on all sides

WHAT MAKES THIS FEEL DESIGNED (not AI-generated):
- The corner radius of the squircle must be PERFECTLY SMOOTH — continuous curvature, not four circular arcs joined together. This is the difference between an Apple icon and a cheap imitation.
- The M's proportions must feel custom — slightly wider than a standard font M, with the inner V not going too deep (approximately 35-40% of height). This makes it feel purpose-built, not typed.
- The overall form should feel like a PHYSICAL OBJECT — something you could hold, press into clay, or stamp onto paper. Warm and tactile in impression.

WORDMARK — the text "MOVE TO DIGITAL":
- Appears BELOW the logomark with comfortable spacing (gap equal to approximately 30% of the logomark height)
- Font: a bold geometric sans-serif similar to Plus Jakarta Sans SemiBold
- All uppercase: "MOVE TO DIGITAL" as a single line
- Set in Deep Slate (#2D3748)
- Letter-spacing: expanded (+3% tracking)
- The wordmark's total width should be approximately equal to or slightly wider than the logomark, creating a balanced stacked composition
- "TO" can optionally be set in a lighter weight (Regular instead of SemiBold) to create subtle rhythm — only if it looks natural

COLOUR PALETTE — strictly these three, nothing else:
- Primary Terracotta: #C2714F (warm rust-brown) — fills the squircle shape only
- Deep Slate: #2D3748 (dark blue-grey) — the wordmark text only
- White: #FFFFFF — the background and the M negative space
- No other colours. No honey, no gold, no accents. Three colours total.

VISUAL STYLE:
- Flat, vector-style, as if made in Adobe Illustrator or Figma
- No 3D, no gradients, no shadows, no gloss, no glow, no texture, no grain, no bevels
- Must work at 32px (the squircle shape + white M cutout must still read clearly as a favicon)
- Must work at 400px+ (website header, social media)
- Must work on white (#FFFFFF), warm off-white (#FAFAF7), and dark (#2D3748) backgrounds — for dark backgrounds, provide an alternate version where the squircle is Deep Slate and the M cutout is terracotta
- Must work as monochrome (single colour Deep Slate on white)

DIMENSIONS AND DELIVERABLE:
- 1200 x 1200 px, square, white background (#FFFFFF), PNG
- Logomark centred in upper portion, wordmark centred below
- Generous padding: at least 18% of width on each side
- The logomark squircle should be approximately 400-450px wide within the 1200px canvas

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- The squircle must have PERFECTLY SMOOTH continuous-curvature corners (Apple-quality, not Android-quality)
- The M must be immediately and unambiguously the letter M — a standard, bold, geometric sans-serif M with no cleverness, no hidden meanings, no double-reads
- The M must NOT look like: mountains, people, legs, figures, arrows, or any object other than the letter M
- The warmth and personality comes from the TECHNIQUE (negative space cutout in a warm-coloured shape) not from the letterform itself — the M is deliberately plain so the container does the work
- The overall impression: "a craftsperson's mark" — warm, confident, modern, built to last
- Think of: the quality of the Notion logo (clean N in a container), the warmth of a Letterpress stamp, the simplicity of a wax seal on an envelope

NEVER INCLUDE: gradients, shadows, 3D effects, gloss, glow, texture, grain, decorative elements, swooshes, organic shapes, illustrations, additional icons, patterns inside the squircle, borders or outlines around the squircle, or any colours outside the three specified.

## 1. Hero Background Texture

```
Create a seamless tileable abstract pattern of interconnected nodes and paths, designed to sit behind website heading text at very low visual prominence. Dimensions: 2400 x 800 px, landscape orientation, PNG with transparency.

COLOUR PALETTE — use ONLY these colours, no others:
- Primary Terracotta: #C2714F (warm rust-brown)
- Primary Dark: #A85A3A (deeper terracotta for contrast)
- Deep Slate: #2D3748 (dark blue-grey)
- Honey Accent: #D4A574 (warm golden-brown)
- Primary Light: #D4956F (soft peach-terracotta)
- Warm Stone Background: #FAFAF7 (near-white with warm undertone)
- Alternate Background: #F3F0EB (light warm grey-beige)
- Border/Muted: #E5E0DA (warm light grey)

VISUAL STYLE — apply to the entire image:
- Flat geometric forms — no 3D, no gradients, no gloss, no drop shadows
- Matte finish throughout, as if printed on uncoated stock paper
- Fine-grain paper texture overlay at 5% opacity across the entire image
- Clean vector-like edges — not painterly, not photographic
- Line weight: thin (1-2px equivalent at output resolution)
- Shapes: circles (nodes) and straight lines (connections)
- The visual language should suggest "system architecture diagram abstracted into minimalist art"

COMPOSITION:
- 15-20 small circles (diameter 4-8px equivalent) scattered across the canvas in an organic but balanced distribution — not a rigid grid, not random clutter
- Circles connected by thin straight lines forming a loose network/constellation pattern
- Some circles are connected to 2-3 others, some are isolated — suggesting a partially-connected integration network
- All circles use Primary Terracotta (#C2714F) at 12% opacity
- All connecting lines use Deep Slate (#2D3748) at 6% opacity
- Background: completely transparent (alpha channel)

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- This image sits BEHIND large heading text — it must be extremely subtle
- The overall impression at normal viewing distance should be "warm textured surface" not "network diagram"
- Must tile seamlessly on all four edges
- Test: if you squint, you should barely see the pattern

NEVER INCLUDE: text, logos, watermarks, people, faces, hands, human forms, photographic elements, stock imagery, lens flare, bokeh, glow, neon, light effects, 3D perspective, isometric views, or any colours outside the palette above.

## 2. About Page Backdrop

```
Create an abstract geometric composition suggesting data flow and system integration, suitable as a subtle background behind a biography text block on a professional portfolio website. Dimensions: 1600 x 900 px, landscape orientation, PNG.

COLOUR PALETTE — use ONLY these colours, no others:
- Primary Terracotta: #C2714F (warm rust-brown)

VISUAL STYLE — apply to the entire image:
- Flat geometric forms — no 3D, no gradients, no gloss, no drop shadows
- Matte finish throughout, as if printed on uncoated stock paper
- Fine-grain paper texture overlay at 5% opacity across the entire image
- Clean vector-like edges — not painterly, not photographic
- Line weight: thin (1-2px equivalent at output resolution)
- Shapes: circles (nodes), straight lines (connections), rounded rectangles (containers)
- The visual language should suggest "system architecture diagram abstracted into minimalist art"

COMPOSITION:
- Left third: 3-4 rounded rectangles (representing source systems) arranged vertically, using Deep Slate (#2D3748) as 8% opacity fills with Border (#E5E0DA) strokes
- Centre: thin horizontal and diagonal connecting lines (Deep Slate at 6% opacity) flowing from left containers toward a central node
- Centre focal point: one slightly larger circle in Primary Terracotta (#C2714F) at 15% opacity — the "bridge" or "integration point"
- Right third: 2-3 rounded rectangles (representing target systems) with connecting lines from the central node
- Sparse — 60%+ of the canvas should be empty Warm Stone Background (#FAFAF7)
- Small Honey Accent (#D4A574) dots at 10% opacity scattered along the connection paths, suggesting data in transit

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- This sits behind readable body text — must remain very low contrast
- The eye should first read the text overlay; the background should register as "warm, subtly technical atmosphere"
- No element should have opacity above 15%
- Overall mood: quiet, precise, warm

NEVER INCLUDE: text, logos, watermarks, people, faces, hands, human forms, photographic elements, stock imagery, lens flare, bokeh, glow, neon, light effects, 3D perspective, isometric views, or any colours outside the palette above.

- The visual language should suggest "system architecture diagram abstracted into minimalist art"

COMPOSITION — precise layout:
- Background: solid Deep Slate (#2D3748), full bleed
- Top-left corner: a small abstract node cluster (5-6 small circles connected by thin lines) using Primary Terracotta (#C2714F) at 20% opacity, contained within the top-left 200x200px area — a subtle brand motif
- Vertically centred, horizontally centred:
  - Line 1: "Move to Digital" in a bold geometric sans-serif font (similar to Plus Jakarta Sans Bold or Montserrat Bold), colour Primary Terracotta (#C2714F), size approximately 64px equivalent
  - 24px vertical gap
  - Line 2: A thin horizontal rule, 120px wide, centred, colour Honey Accent (#D4A574) at 60% opacity
  - 16px vertical gap
  - Line 3: "Automation & Integration Architecture" in a regular-weight geometric sans-serif font, colour Honey Accent (#D4A574), size approximately 24px equivalent, letter-spacing +1px
- Bottom-right corner: "movetodigital.au" in small text (14px equivalent), colour Border (#E5E0DA) at 50% opacity, 32px from edges

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Text must be sharp and fully legible at the typical OG preview size (roughly 600x315px display)
- The node cluster in the top-left should NOT compete with the text — it is a subtle atmospheric element
- Overall impression: "serious professional practice" — not "tech startup", not "marketing agency"
- Must look good on both light and dark social media backgrounds

NEVER INCLUDE: stock imagery, photographic elements, lens flare, bokeh, glow, neon, light effects, 3D perspective, isometric views, illustrations of people or objects, or any colours outside the palette above.

- Centred in the square: the uppercase letter "M" in a bold geometric sans-serif font (similar to Plus Jakarta Sans ExtraBold or Montserrat Bold)
- Letter colour: Primary Terracotta (#C2714F)
- Letter should occupy approximately 55-60% of the square's height
- The letter should be optically centred (slightly above mathematical centre, as is standard for icon design)
- No additional decorative elements whatsoever

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Must remain legible and recognisable when scaled to 32x32px (browser tab size)
- Must also look good at 180x180px (Apple touch icon size)
