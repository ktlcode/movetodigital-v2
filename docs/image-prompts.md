## 0. Brand Logo — Primary Wordmark + Icon

```
Design a professional logo for "Move to Digital" — an independent automation and integration architecture practice based in Australia. The logo must communicate precision, structure, and technical authority.

CONCEPT DIRECTION — the logomark (icon):
The logomark is a SOLID, FILLED, BLOCKY letter "M" constructed entirely from straight lines and sharp angles on a strict geometric grid. This is NOT a clever conceptual logo — it is a clean, confident, architectural letterform. Think of how a structural engineer would draw the letter M: precise, load-bearing, no decoration.

EXACT GEOMETRIC CONSTRUCTION of the "M":
- The M is built from FIVE solid rectangular bars/strokes of equal width, arranged to form the letter
- Two vertical bars on the far left and far right (the outer legs)
- Two diagonal bars angling inward from the top of each outer leg, meeting at the centre bottom
- The diagonals meet at a sharp V-point at approximately 40% of the total height from the bottom
- ALL corners are sharp 90-degree or precise angled cuts — NO rounded corners, NO rounded terminals, NO circles, NO curves of any kind
- The stroke width of each bar should be approximately 15-18% of the total letter width
- The overall proportions should be slightly wider than tall (ratio approximately 1.15:1)
- The letter should feel SOLID and HEAVY — like it's carved from stone or milled from metal

WHAT THE "M" MUST NOT LOOK LIKE:
- Must NOT have rounded ends, circular terminals, or dots at any point — this makes it look like human figures or body parts
- Must NOT have curved strokes — curves make it look organic/human
- Must NOT look like mountains, peaks, or a heartbeat monitor line
- Must NOT look like two people, stick figures, legs, or any human form when viewed from any angle or orientation
- Must NOT use thin or delicate strokes — it must feel substantial and architectural
- Every edge must be a clean straight cut

COLOUR APPLICATION on the logomark:
- The entire M is filled in Primary Terracotta (#C2714F) as a single solid colour
- No colour variations, no two-tone, no accent colours on the mark itself
- The M should read as one unified, confident shape

WORDMARK — the text "MOVE TO DIGITAL":
- Appears below the logomark (stacked version) or to the right (horizontal version)
- Use a bold geometric sans-serif font similar to Plus Jakarta Sans Bold or DM Sans Bold
- All uppercase: "MOVE TO DIGITAL" as a single line
- Set in Deep Slate (#2D3748)
- Letter-spacing: slightly expanded (+2-3% tracking) for a clean, airy feel
- The wordmark should be noticeably lighter in visual weight than the logomark — it supports, not competes

COLOUR PALETTE — use ONLY these three colours, no others:
- Primary Terracotta: #C2714F (warm rust-brown) — the logomark only
- Deep Slate: #2D3748 (dark blue-grey) — the wordmark text only
- White: #FFFFFF — the background only
- No honey, no gold, no accent colours. Two colours plus white. That's it.

VISUAL STYLE:
- Flat, geometric, vector-style — as if constructed in Adobe Illustrator using only the rectangle tool and the rotate tool
- Absolutely no 3D effects, no gradients, no shadows, no gloss, no glow, no texture, no grain
- The logo must look like it could be cut from a single sheet of metal with a laser
- Must work at small sizes (32px favicon — the M shape must still be recognisable) and large sizes (website header)
- Must work on both pure white (#FFFFFF) and warm off-white (#FAFAF7) backgrounds
- Must work as single-colour Deep Slate (#2D3748) for monochrome printing

LAYOUT — produce the STACKED version only:
- Logomark centred above the wordmark
- Vertical arrangement, suitable for square spaces
- Dimensions: 1200 x 1200 px, square, white background (#FFFFFF), PNG
- Generous padding: at least 20% of width on each side
- The logomark should occupy roughly the top 45% of the composition, wordmark in the lower portion

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- The M must be IMMEDIATELY and UNAMBIGUOUSLY readable as the letter M by anyone, in any context, at any size, from any distance
- There must be absolutely zero possibility of the shape being mistaken for human figures, body parts, mountains, or any other object
- Every single edge and corner must be a clean, straight, sharp cut — zero curves
- The logo must feel like it was designed by a Swiss typographer who values precision above cleverness
- The overall impression: "solid, warm, architectural, precise" — like a building you'd trust to stand for decades
- Reference the restraint of: IBM's 8-bar logo, Stripe's wordmark, Linear's logomark, Vercel's triangle — match that level of geometric discipline. Do NOT copy any of these designs.

NEVER INCLUDE: curves, rounded corners, rounded terminals, circles, dots, nodes, organic shapes, gradients, shadows, 3D effects, gloss, glow, texture, grain, decorative elements, swooshes, flourishes, illustrations, or any colours outside the three specified above (terracotta, slate, white).

## 1. Hero Background Texture

```
Create a seamless tileable abstract pattern of interconnected nodes and paths, designed to sit behind website heading text at very low visual prominence. Dimensions: 2400 x 800 px, landscape orientation, PNG with transparency.

COLOUR PALETTE — use ONLY these colours, no others:
- Primary Terracotta: #C2714F (warm rust-brown)
- Primary Dark: #A85A3A (deeper terracotta for contrast)
- Deep Slate: #2D3748 (dark blue-grey)
- Honey Accent: #D4A574 (warm golden-brown)
- Primary Light: #D4956F (soft peach-terracotta)
- Warm Stone Background: #FAFAF7 (near-white with warm undertone)
- Alternate Background: #F3F0EB (light warm grey-beige)
- Border/Muted: #E5E0DA (warm light grey)

VISUAL STYLE — apply to the entire image:
- Flat geometric forms — no 3D, no gradients, no gloss, no drop shadows
- Matte finish throughout, as if printed on uncoated stock paper
- Fine-grain paper texture overlay at 5% opacity across the entire image
- Clean vector-like edges — not painterly, not photographic
- Line weight: thin (1-2px equivalent at output resolution)
- Shapes: circles (nodes) and straight lines (connections)
- The visual language should suggest "system architecture diagram abstracted into minimalist art"

COMPOSITION:
- 15-20 small circles (diameter 4-8px equivalent) scattered across the canvas in an organic but balanced distribution — not a rigid grid, not random clutter
- Circles connected by thin straight lines forming a loose network/constellation pattern
- Some circles are connected to 2-3 others, some are isolated — suggesting a partially-connected integration network
- All circles use Primary Terracotta (#C2714F) at 12% opacity
- All connecting lines use Deep Slate (#2D3748) at 6% opacity
- Background: completely transparent (alpha channel)

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- This image sits BEHIND large heading text — it must be extremely subtle
- The overall impression at normal viewing distance should be "warm textured surface" not "network diagram"
- Must tile seamlessly on all four edges
- Test: if you squint, you should barely see the pattern

NEVER INCLUDE: text, logos, watermarks, people, faces, hands, human forms, photographic elements, stock imagery, lens flare, bokeh, glow, neon, light effects, 3D perspective, isometric views, or any colours outside the palette above.

## 2. About Page Backdrop

```
Create an abstract geometric composition suggesting data flow and system integration, suitable as a subtle background behind a biography text block on a professional portfolio website. Dimensions: 1600 x 900 px, landscape orientation, PNG.

COLOUR PALETTE — use ONLY these colours, no others:

- Clean vector-like edges — not painterly, not photographic
- Line weight: thin (1-2px equivalent at output resolution)
- Shapes: circles (nodes), straight lines (connections), rounded rectangles (containers)
- The visual language should suggest "system architecture diagram abstracted into minimalist art"

COMPOSITION:
- Left third: 3-4 rounded rectangles (representing source systems) arranged vertically, using Deep Slate (#2D3748) as 8% opacity fills with Border (#E5E0DA) strokes
- Centre: thin horizontal and diagonal connecting lines (Deep Slate at 6% opacity) flowing from left containers toward a central node
- Centre focal point: one slightly larger circle in Primary Terracotta (#C2714F) at 15% opacity — the "bridge" or "integration point"
- Right third: 2-3 rounded rectangles (representing target systems) with connecting lines from the central node
- Sparse — 60%+ of the canvas should be empty Warm Stone Background (#FAFAF7)
- Small Honey Accent (#D4A574) dots at 10% opacity scattered along the connection paths, suggesting data in transit

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- This sits behind readable body text — must remain very low contrast
- The eye should first read the text overlay; the background should register as "warm, subtly technical atmosphere"
- No element should have opacity above 15%
- Overall mood: quiet, precise, warm

NEVER INCLUDE: text, logos, watermarks, people, faces, hands, human forms, photographic elements, stock imagery, lens flare, bokeh, glow, neon, light effects, 3D perspective, isometric views, or any colours outside the palette above.

- Vertically centred, horizontally centred:
  - Line 1: "Move to Digital" in a bold geometric sans-serif font (similar to Plus Jakarta Sans Bold or Montserrat Bold), colour Primary Terracotta (#C2714F), size approximately 64px equivalent
  - 24px vertical gap
  - Line 2: A thin horizontal rule, 120px wide, centred, colour Honey Accent (#D4A574) at 60% opacity
  - 16px vertical gap
  - Line 3: "Automation & Integration Architecture" in a regular-weight geometric sans-serif font, colour Honey Accent (#D4A574), size approximately 24px equivalent, letter-spacing +1px
