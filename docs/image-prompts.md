## 0. Brand Logo — Primary Wordmark + Icon

```
Design a professional logo for "Move to Digital" — an independent automation and integration architecture practice based in Australia. The practice specialises in connecting enterprise systems securely: building middleware, APIs, and event-driven bridges between platforms. The logo must communicate precision, connection, and technical authority — NOT nature, adventure, mountains, sunrises, or generic digital transformation.

CONCEPT DIRECTION — the logomark (icon) should:
- Be built from the letter "M" but constructed using a visual metaphor of integration: two distinct systems (represented as simple geometric nodes or endpoints) connected by a bridge, pathway, or routing line that forms the shape of the letter "M"
- The "M" should be readable as a letter first, with the integration/connection concept as a secondary "aha" — not the other way around
- Think of it as: the left leg of the "M" is one system, the right leg is another system, and the centre peak is the bridge/integration point connecting them
- The connection point (centre peak of the "M") could be subtly emphasised with the Honey Accent colour (#D4A574) while the two legs use Primary Terracotta (#C2714F), suggesting two systems being joined
- Alternatively, the "M" could be formed from three connected nodes (circles at the base and peak) joined by clean angled lines — like a simplified network graph that happens to form an "M"
- The overall form should be geometric, clean, and symmetrical
- Stroke-based construction (consistent line weight) is preferred over filled/solid shapes
- If using nodes (circles at connection points), they should be small and precise — 3-4 nodes maximum

WORDMARK — the text "MOVE TO DIGITAL" should:
- Appear below the logomark
- Use a bold geometric sans-serif font similar to Plus Jakarta Sans Bold or DM Sans Bold
- Be set in Deep Slate (#2D3748)
- Letter-spacing: slightly expanded (+2-3% tracking) for a clean, airy feel
- "MOVE TO DIGITAL" as a single line, all uppercase
- Optionally, "MOVE TO" in regular weight and "DIGITAL" in bold weight for subtle emphasis — but only if it looks natural, not forced

COLOUR PALETTE — use ONLY these colours, no others:
- Primary Terracotta: #C2714F (warm rust-brown) — primary colour for the logomark
- Honey Accent: #D4A574 (warm golden-brown) — accent for the connection/bridge point only
- Deep Slate: #2D3748 (dark blue-grey) — for the wordmark text
- These three colours only. No teal, no cyan, no bright blue, no green, no purple.

VISUAL STYLE:
- Flat, geometric, vector-style — as if designed in Adobe Illustrator with the pen tool
- No 3D effects, no gradients, no shadows, no gloss, no glow
- No texture or grain on the logo itself (unlike the background images — logos must be clean vectors)
- Consistent stroke weight if stroke-based; consistent visual weight if filled
- Must work at small sizes (32px favicon) and large sizes (header on a website)
- Must work on both white (#FFFFFF) and warm off-white (#FAFAF7) backgrounds
- Must work in single-colour (all Deep Slate) for monochrome applications

LAYOUT — produce TWO versions:
1. STACKED: logomark centred above the wordmark, vertical arrangement, suitable for square or portrait spaces
2. HORIZONTAL: logomark to the left of the wordmark, inline arrangement, suitable for website navigation headers

DIMENSIONS:
- Stacked version: 1200 x 1200 px, square, white background (#FFFFFF), PNG
- Horizontal version: 2400 x 600 px, landscape, white background (#FFFFFF), PNG
- Ensure generous padding around the logo (at least 15% of width on each side)

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- The logomark must be immediately readable as the letter "M"
- The integration/connection concept should be a subtle layer of meaning, not the primary read
- Must NOT look AI-generated — no over-smoothed curves, no unnecessary complexity, no meaningless swooshes
- Must NOT resemble: mountains, peaks, waves, sunrises, sunsets, globes, arrows, shields, or any other overused logo cliché
- Must feel like it was designed by a human typographer/brand designer with 10+ years of experience
- The overall impression should be: "precise, warm, confident, technical"
- Compare against logos from Thoughtworks, Palantir, Stripe, HashiCorp for tone (serious technology practice) — do NOT copy their designs, just match the level of restraint and intentionality

NEVER INCLUDE: gradients, shadows, 3D effects, gloss, glow, stock imagery, decorative flourishes, organic/natural shapes, illustrations, mascots, icons that don't relate to integration architecture, or any colours outside the three specified above.

## 1. Hero Background Texture

```
Create a seamless tileable abstract pattern of interconnected nodes and paths, designed to sit behind website heading text at very low visual prominence. Dimensions: 2400 x 800 px, landscape orientation, PNG with transparency.

COLOUR PALETTE — use ONLY these colours, no others:
- Primary Terracotta: #C2714F (warm rust-brown)
- Primary Dark: #A85A3A (deeper terracotta for contrast)
- Deep Slate: #2D3748 (dark blue-grey)
- Honey Accent: #D4A574 (warm golden-brown)
- Primary Light: #D4956F (soft peach-terracotta)
- Warm Stone Background: #FAFAF7 (near-white with warm undertone)
- Alternate Background: #F3F0EB (light warm grey-beige)
- Border/Muted: #E5E0DA (warm light grey)

VISUAL STYLE — apply to the entire image:
- Flat geometric forms — no 3D, no gradients, no gloss, no drop shadows
- Matte finish throughout, as if printed on uncoated stock paper
- Fine-grain paper texture overlay at 5% opacity across the entire image
- Clean vector-like edges — not painterly, not photographic
- Line weight: thin (1-2px equivalent at output resolution)
- Shapes: circles (nodes) and straight lines (connections)
- The visual language should suggest "system architecture diagram abstracted into minimalist art"

COMPOSITION:
- 15-20 small circles (diameter 4-8px equivalent) scattered across the canvas in an organic but balanced distribution — not a rigid grid, not random clutter
- Circles connected by thin straight lines forming a loose network/constellation pattern
- Some circles are connected to 2-3 others, some are isolated — suggesting a partially-connected integration network
- All circles use Primary Terracotta (#C2714F) at 12% opacity
- All connecting lines use Deep Slate (#2D3748) at 6% opacity
- Background: completely transparent (alpha channel)

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- This image sits BEHIND large heading text — it must be extremely subtle
- The overall impression at normal viewing distance should be "warm textured surface" not "network diagram"
- Must tile seamlessly on all four edges
- Test: if you squint, you should barely see the pattern

NEVER INCLUDE: text, logos, watermarks, people, faces, hands, human forms, photographic elements, stock imagery, lens flare, bokeh, glow, neon, light effects, 3D perspective, isometric views, or any colours outside the palette above.

## 2. About Page Backdrop

```
Create an abstract geometric composition suggesting data flow and system integration, suitable as a subtle background behind a biography text block on a professional portfolio website. Dimensions: 1600 x 900 px, landscape orientation, PNG.

COLOUR PALETTE — use ONLY these colours, no others:
- Primary Terracotta: #C2714F (warm rust-brown)
- Primary Dark: #A85A3A (deeper terracotta for contrast)
- Deep Slate: #2D3748 (dark blue-grey)
- Honey Accent: #D4A574 (warm golden-brown)

- Warm Stone Background: #FAFAF7 (near-white with warm undertone)
- Alternate Background: #F3F0EB (light warm grey-beige)
- Border/Muted: #E5E0DA (warm light grey)

VISUAL STYLE — apply to the entire image:
- Flat geometric forms — no 3D, no gradients, no gloss, no drop shadows
- Matte finish throughout, as if printed on uncoated stock paper
- Fine-grain paper texture overlay at 5% opacity across the entire image
- Clean vector-like edges — not painterly, not photographic
- Line weight: thin (1-2px equivalent at output resolution)
- Shapes: circles (nodes), straight lines (connections), rounded rectangles (containers)
- The visual language should suggest "system architecture diagram abstracted into minimalist art"

COMPOSITION:
- Left third: 3-4 rounded rectangles (representing source systems) arranged vertically, using Deep Slate (#2D3748) as 8% opacity fills with Border (#E5E0DA) strokes
- Centre: thin horizontal and diagonal connecting lines (Deep Slate at 6% opacity) flowing from left containers toward a central node
- Centre focal point: one slightly larger circle in Primary Terracotta (#C2714F) at 15% opacity — the "bridge" or "integration point"
- Right third: 2-3 rounded rectangles (representing target systems) with connecting lines from the central node
- Sparse — 60%+ of the canvas should be empty Warm Stone Background (#FAFAF7)
- Small Honey Accent (#D4A574) dots at 10% opacity scattered along the connection paths, suggesting data in transit

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- This sits behind readable body text — must remain very low contrast
- The eye should first read the text overlay; the background should register as "warm, subtly technical atmosphere"
- No element should have opacity above 15%
- Overall mood: quiet, precise, warm

NEVER INCLUDE: text, logos, watermarks, people, faces, hands, human forms, photographic elements, stock imagery, lens flare, bokeh, glow, neon, light effects, 3D perspective, isometric views, or any colours outside the palette above.

- The visual language should suggest "system architecture diagram abstracted into minimalist art"

COMPOSITION — precise layout:
- Background: solid Deep Slate (#2D3748), full bleed
- Top-left corner: a small abstract node cluster (5-6 small circles connected by thin lines) using Primary Terracotta (#C2714F) at 20% opacity, contained within the top-left 200x200px area — a subtle brand motif
- Vertically centred, horizontally centred:
  - Line 1: "Move to Digital" in a bold geometric sans-serif font (similar to Plus Jakarta Sans Bold or Montserrat Bold), colour Primary Terracotta (#C2714F), size approximately 64px equivalent
  - 24px vertical gap
  - Line 2: A thin horizontal rule, 120px wide, centred, colour Honey Accent (#D4A574) at 60% opacity
  - 16px vertical gap
  - Line 3: "Automation & Integration Architecture" in a regular-weight geometric sans-serif font, colour Honey Accent (#D4A574), size approximately 24px equivalent, letter-spacing +1px
- Bottom-right corner: "movetodigital.au" in small text (14px equivalent), colour Border (#E5E0DA) at 50% opacity, 32px from edges

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Text must be sharp and fully legible at the typical OG preview size (roughly 600x315px display)
- The node cluster in the top-left should NOT compete with the text — it is a subtle atmospheric element
- Overall impression: "serious professional practice" — not "tech startup", not "marketing agency"
- Must look good on both light and dark social media backgrounds

NEVER INCLUDE: stock imagery, photographic elements, lens flare, bokeh, glow, neon, light effects, 3D perspective, isometric views, illustrations of people or objects, or any colours outside the palette above.

- Centred in the square: the uppercase letter "M" in a bold geometric sans-serif font (similar to Plus Jakarta Sans ExtraBold or Montserrat Bold)
- Letter colour: Primary Terracotta (#C2714F)
- Letter should occupy approximately 55-60% of the square's height
- The letter should be optically centred (slightly above mathematical centre, as is standard for icon design)
- No additional decorative elements whatsoever

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Must remain legible and recognisable when scaled to 32x32px (browser tab size)
- Must also look good at 180x180px (Apple touch icon size)
- The "M" must have clean, geometric strokes — no serifs, no decorative features
- Test at small sizes: the letterform should be immediately identifiable as the letter M
