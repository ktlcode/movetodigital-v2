--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[H2] Security Events -> SMS Notifications
[Label] Independent architecture + build engagement
[Subtitle] Gallagher Command Centre <-> Telstra Messaging API
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[H3] Context / Problem
The client's physical security platform (Gallagher Command Centre) generates
critical events (door forced, access denied, alarm triggered) but has no
native SMS notification capability. Operators needed real-time alerts on mobile
devices, with intelligent filtering to prevent alert fatigue. The requirement was
for a middleware bridge that could poll, process, and deliver notifications
reliably without introducing new security risk.

[H3] Constraints
- Physical security environment. No tolerance for missed events or false negatives.
- Gallagher API requires mutual TLS client certificate authentication.
- Telstra Messaging API v3 requires OAuth2 bearer token management with automatic refresh.
- Minimal PII handling. Event metadata only, no personal data in transit.
- Solution must be operable by non-technical staff after handover.

[H3] Solution Approach
Designed and built an event-driven middleware bridge. The system polls
Gallagher's REST API over mutual TLS, processes and deduplicates events through
a configurable rules engine, composes human-readable notification messages, and
delivers via Telstra's Messaging API v3.

[H3] Architecture
[Architecture Diagram — interactive SVG]
Flow: Gallagher Command Centre (Security Event Source)
  -> HTTPS / mTLS Event Polling ->
  Bridge (Event Processor)
    - Event Processing
    - Deduplication
    - Filtering Rules
    - Audit Logging
  -> OAuth2 / REST SMS Delivery ->
  Telstra Messaging API v3 (SMS Delivery)
  Bridge also connects to:
  Operator Dashboard (Monitoring & Configuration, Certificate Management)

[H3] Automation & Integration
- Event polling. Scheduled polling of Gallagher REST API with configurable
  intervals and checkpoint tracking.
- Rules engine. Configurable event filtering, deduplication, and alert routing.
  Operators can adjust thresholds without code changes.
- Message composition. Events are transformed into human-readable SMS
  notifications with contextual detail.
- Rate limiting and queuing. Message delivery is rate-limited and queued to
  comply with Telstra API constraints and prevent notification storms.

[H3] Governance & Controls
- Identity. Gallagher API authenticated via mutual TLS client certificates.
  Telstra API via OAuth2 bearer tokens with automatic refresh. No shared secrets.
- Data boundaries. Event metadata only is processed. No PII is stored or
  transmitted beyond what the notification requires. Message content is ephemeral.
- Audit logging. Every event received, every rule evaluation, every notification
  sent is logged with timestamps and correlation identifiers.
- Operator controls. Non-technical operators manage filtering rules, certificate
  renewal, and system configuration through a dashboard. No direct API or
  database access required.

[H3] Security
All communication uses TLS 1.2+. Gallagher API access is authenticated via
mutual TLS client certificates. Telstra API uses OAuth2 bearer tokens with
automatic refresh. API keys are hashed with PBKDF2 and stored with AES-256
encryption. The system handles minimal personal data, event metadata only, no
PII in transit.

[H3] AI-Assisted Engineering
AI tooling was used during the build phase to accelerate scaffolding, improve
edge-case analysis, and assist with documentation generation. All AI-generated
outputs were manually reviewed and validated before integration. AI was not used
for operational decision-making. The rules engine and notification logic are
deterministic. AI assisted build velocity; it did not replace engineering
judgement.

[H3] Delivery Notes
- Delivered as a complete working system: middleware, operator dashboard,
  certificate management tooling, and audit logging.
- Zero-touch deployment capability designed for non-technical operators.
- Full documentation and operational runbooks provided for handover.
- Deployment pending customer rollout scheduling.

[H3] Outcomes
- Working middleware with operator dashboard, certificate lifecycle management,
  and comprehensive audit logging.
- Configurable rules engine enabling non-technical staff to manage alert
  filtering without developer intervention.
- Architecture designed for zero-touch deployment in customer environments.

[H3] Extensibility / Next Steps
Architecture supports additional notification channels (email, Microsoft Teams
webhooks), configurable multi-tenant deployment, and integration with additional
event sources. Rate limiting and message queuing patterns are reusable across
notification pipelines.

Meta title: "Structured Intake Automation — PDF to Digital Workflow Architecture | Move to Digital"
Meta description: "Schema-driven architecture transforming PDF assessment

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[H2] Structured Intake Automation
[Label] Product architecture and build capability
[Subtitle] PDF -> Canonical Schema -> Interactive Digital Workflow
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[H3] Context / Problem
Clinicians were spending significant time manually transcribing standardised
assessment forms from paper and PDF into digital records. The process was
error-prone, created workflow bottlenecks, and made consistent scoring difficult.
Assessment instruments vary in structure but share common patterns (sections,
question types, scoring rubrics) that lend themselves to a structured,
schema-driven approach.

[H3] Constraints
- Clinical environment. Accuracy of scoring and data capture is non-negotiable.
- Assessment instruments are published as static PDFs with no machine-readable
  structure.
- Clinician users include neurodivergent practitioners. UX must minimise
  cognitive load, reduce visual noise, and support focused task completion.
- Data governance requirements: clear boundaries on what is stored, where, and
  for how long.

[H3] Solution Approach
Built a three-stage pipeline that decouples ingestion from rendering:

1. PDF analysis. Source PDF instruments are analysed and structured data is
   extracted into a canonical JSON schema. Each section, question, and scoring
   rubric is mapped to a normalised data model.
2. Canonical schema. The schema serves as the single source of truth, decoupling
   the source format from the rendering engine. New instruments can be onboarded
   by producing a schema. No UI code changes required.
3. Interactive form rendering. Schemas are rendered as interactive digital forms
   (SurveyJS-based) with real-time scoring, validation, and section-level
   progress tracking.

[H3] Architecture
- Ingestion layer. PDF analysis produces canonical JSON schemas conforming to a
  defined instrument specification.
- Schema registry. Canonical schemas stored with versioning and deterministic
  identity (content-derived slugs), enabling reproducible builds and eliminating
  manual ID management.
- Rendering engine. SurveyJS-based form renderer consumes schemas and produces
  interactive assessments with real-time scoring.
- Scoring engine. Automated scoring logic embedded in the schema definition.
  Subscale calculations, reverse scoring, and threshold flagging are computed in
  real time as the clinician completes the form.

[H3] Automation & Integration
- Schema generation. AI-assisted extraction of structure from PDF instruments,
  with manual validation and correction at every stage.
- Deterministic identity. Each instrument, section, and question receives a
  content-derived slug. This eliminates brittle numeric IDs and reduces friction
  when instruments are updated or versioned.
- Real-time scoring. Scoring rules are defined in the schema and executed
  client-side as forms are completed. No round-trip to a server required for
  score calculation.
- Instrument onboarding. Adding a new assessment instrument requires producing a
  conforming schema. The rendering engine handles the rest.

[H3] Governance & Controls
- Data boundaries. Assessment responses are processed client-side. The platform
  defines clear boundaries on what is persisted, what is ephemeral, and what is
  exportable.
- Schema validation. Instruments must conform to the canonical specification.
  Malformed schemas are rejected at onboarding.
- Auditability. Schema versions, scoring logic, and instrument definitions are
  versioned and traceable.
- Human-in-loop. AI-assisted schema extraction is always reviewed and validated
  by a human before an instrument enters production use. AI accelerates the
  analysis; clinicians and architects validate the output.

[H3] Security
Assessment data is handled with appropriate sensitivity controls. The platform
does not store identified patient data. Schema definitions and scoring logic are
versioned and integrity-checked. Access controls and data handling follow the
principle of least privilege.

[H3] Delivery Notes
- Designed and operated as a productised workflow automation capability, applying
  the same governance and architecture patterns used in enterprise engagements.
- Production deployment supporting multiple assessment instrument types.
- Clinician-facing interface with neurodivergent-first UX: reduced visual
  clutter, consistent navigation, clear progress indicators, and minimal
  context-switching.

[H3] Outcomes
- Production platform supporting multiple standardised assessment instruments
  with automated real-time scoring.
- Canonical schema approach enables rapid onboarding of new instruments without
  UI code changes.
- Neurodivergent-friendly interface validated through clinician feedback during
  development.
- Deterministic identity model (content-derived slugs) eliminates a class of data
  management errors common in form-based systems.

[H3] Extensibility / Next Steps
Schema-driven architecture supports additional instrument types, export formats,
and integration with clinical record systems. The canonical model is designed to
accommodate future requirements (e.g. longitudinal tracking, multi-rater
instruments) without structural changes to the rendering or scoring engines.

[H2] Real-Time Cross-Platform Application
[Label] Product architecture and build capability
[Subtitle] Expo React Native <-> Convex Reactive Backend <-> Cloudflare Edge
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[H3] Context / Problem
The product required a social application available on iOS, Android, and web
from a single codebase, with real-time data synchronisation across all clients,
multi-provider authentication (Google, Apple, email), regional content
partitioning, and a gamification layer with leaderboards and lifecycle tracking.
The architecture needed to support complex social graph queries, transactional
email workflows, and edge-optimised OAuth, all while maintaining type safety
end-to-end from database to UI.

[H3] Constraints
- Three deployment targets (iOS, Android, web) from a single TypeScript
  codebase. No platform-specific forks.
- Real-time data synchronisation. Changes must propagate to all connected
  clients without manual refresh or polling.
- Multi-provider OAuth (Google, Apple) with custom domain continuity. Users must
  see the product domain throughout the auth flow, not the backend provider.
- Regional data partitioning. Content catalogue varies by geography with global
  and region-specific entries.
- Rate-limited external APIs (email provider). System must queue, prioritise,
  and retry without message loss.

[H3] Solution Approach
Designed and built a reactive full-stack architecture centred on Convex as the
real-time backend, Expo (React Native) as the cross-platform client framework,
and Cloudflare edge functions as the OAuth and static hosting layer. The
architecture eliminates REST APIs entirely. All client-server communication uses
generated TypeScript SDKs with automatic real-time subscriptions. Authentication
is handled by Better Auth with a custom Cloudflare Pages Function proxy that
rewrites OAuth redirect headers to maintain custom domain continuity.

[H3] Architecture
[Architecture Diagram — interactive SVG]
Flow:
  Expo Clients (iOS / Android / Web — Single TypeScript Codebase)
    <-> Real-Time Subscriptions <->
  Convex Backend (Reactive Database + Functions)
    - Real-Time Database (24 tables)
    - Better Auth (Google, Apple, Email)
    - Generated TypeScript SDK
    - Queries, Mutations, Actions
    - Full-Text Search Indexes
    - Scheduled Cron Jobs
    - Email Queue + Rate Limiting
    - Regional Data Partitioning
    - Database Migrations
  Convex also connects to:
    <-> OAuth Proxy / Header Rewrite <-> Cloudflare Edge (Pages, Functions, SSL/DDoS/DNS)
    -> SMTP API / Transactional -> Maileroo (Transactional Email)
  Architecture Patterns (below):
    Code Health Lifecycle | Social Graph Discovery
    Denormalized Leaderboards | Priority Email Queue
    Soft Deletes / Audit Trail | Batch Fetch Optimization
    Regional Data Partitioning | Content-Scoped Search

[H3] Automation & Integration
- Real-time reactive subscriptions. Convex database queries automatically
  subscribe to changes. Client components re-render when underlying data
  changes. Zero manual cache invalidation, zero polling.
- Generated TypeScript SDK. Backend functions (queries, mutations, actions) are
  exposed to the client through a generated, fully-typed SDK. No REST endpoints,
  no API versioning, no serialisation layer.
- Edge-optimised OAuth proxy. Cloudflare Pages Function intercepts OAuth
  callback redirects and rewrites Location headers from the backend domain to the
  custom domain. Users see the product domain throughout the sign-in flow.
- Multi-stage lifecycle tracking. Content entries follow a state machine
  (active -> warning -> suspended) with configurable grace periods. Cron jobs
  enforce time-based transitions. Users receive notifications at each stage.
- Priority email queue. Transactional emails are queued with priority levels,
  daily/monthly quota enforcement, and exponential backoff retry. Immediate-
  priority emails bypass the queue; batch emails are aggregated and rate-limited.
- Regional data partitioning. Content is region-aware with per-region seed data.
  Queries are scoped by user region with global fallback. Regional community
  groups enforce content isolation boundaries.

[H3] Governance & Controls
- Identity & access. Multi-provider authentication (Google OAuth, Apple Sign In,
  email/password, magic link) via Better Auth with custom Convex adapter. Native
  apps use platform-secure storage (SecureStore); web uses bearer tokens. Every
  backend function verifies session ownership before data access.
- Data boundaries. All queries are scoped to the authenticated user. Cross-user
  operations verify ownership. Community content is isolated from private
  content. Global search excludes community-scoped data.
- Soft deletes & audit trail. User data is soft-deleted with deactivation
  reasons. Removal events are logged to audit tables. No hard deletes of
  user-generated content.
- Rate limiting. Email dispatch is quota-controlled (daily and monthly caps).
  Queue backpressure defers non-critical messages. External API calls retry with
  exponential backoff.

[H3] Security
All communication uses HTTPS/TLS. Native authentication tokens are stored in
platform-secure storage (iOS Keychain / Android Keystore via SecureStore). Web
authentication uses signed bearer tokens via Authorization headers. OAuth flows
are proxied through Cloudflare edge functions with header rewriting to prevent
backend domain exposure. Database access is gated by session-verified
functions. No direct client-to-database access. Email sending uses
API-key-authenticated SMTP with queue-based rate limiting. Cloudflare provides
SSL termination, DDoS protection, and DNS management.

[H3] AI-Assisted Engineering
AI tooling was used during the build phase to accelerate schema design, assist
with complex Convex query optimisation, and generate seed data for regional
content catalogues. Database migration scripts and email template generation were
AI-assisted with manual review. All AI-generated code was validated through
manual testing and Convex's type-safe compilation pipeline. AI did not make
architectural decisions. It accelerated implementation of decisions already made.

[H3] Delivery Notes
- Delivered as a complete cross-platform system: iOS app, Android app, web
  application, real-time backend, email infrastructure, and edge authentication
  proxy.
- 24-table database schema with indexing strategy, full-text search, and
  migration framework.
- Over-the-air update capability (Expo Updates) for rapid iteration without app
  store review cycles.
- Production deployment across Convex (backend), Cloudflare Pages (web + edge
  functions), and app stores (iOS/Android).

[H3] Outcomes
- Single TypeScript codebase serving three platforms (iOS, Android, web) with
  approximately 80% code sharing.
- Zero-latency data synchronisation across all connected clients via reactive
  subscriptions. No manual refresh required.
- Custom domain OAuth flow maintaining brand continuity across Google and Apple
  sign-in providers.
- Type-safe data pipeline from database schema through backend functions to
  client components. Compile-time guarantees across the full stack.
- Regional data architecture supporting multi-geography content catalogues with
  isolated community boundaries.

[H3] Extensibility / Next Steps
Architecture supports horizontal feature addition through new Convex functions
and schema extensions. Real-time subscription model scales with additional data
types without infrastructure changes. Regional partitioning can expand to new
geographies by adding seed data. Email queue pattern is reusable for push
notification channels. Authentication layer supports adding new OAuth providers
through Better Auth plugin configuration.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION: Professional Bio
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm an automation and integration architect based in Brisbane, Australia, with
over 20 years of experience across government, utilities, and enterprise
environments.

My work focuses on the space between systems, designing and building secure,
event-driven integrations that connect platforms reliably and pass security
review. I've delivered across the M365 ecosystem, API development, information
governance, cloud infrastructure, and AI-enabled automation workflows.

I operate through Move to Digital, delivering architecture and build engagements
and remaining open to permanent roles and long-term embedded positions where the
work is a strong fit.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION: AI & Governance
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[H2] AI & Governance

I embed AI into enterprise workflows where it adds genuine value, including
document intelligence, schema extraction, build acceleration, and edge-case
analysis, but always within a governance framework appropriate to the
environment.

Data boundaries. Clear separation of what AI processes, what it returns, and
what is stored. No uncontrolled data exfiltration to external services.

Human-in-loop controls. AI-generated outputs are reviewed and validated before
operational use. Automation assists decisions; it does not make them
autonomously.

Audit logging. Where AI is used in a workflow, the inputs, outputs, and human
review decisions are logged and traceable.

Risk-aware design. AI capabilities are scoped to tasks where the failure mode is
acceptable and recoverable. High-stakes decisions remain with humans.

This is not AI for its own sake. It is AI applied with the same engineering
discipline as any other component in a regulated system.
