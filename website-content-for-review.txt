SECTION: Proof Pillars (3 columns)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Pillar 1]
[H3] Integration Architecture
Event-driven APIs, secure middleware, and system integration for platforms that
need to talk to each other reliably. REST, webhooks, message queues — built for
auditability and scale.

[Pillar 2]
[H3] Security-by-Design
OAuth2 flows, mutual TLS, bearer token management, and least-privilege access
patterns. Security is the architecture, not an afterthought.

[Pillar 3]
[H3] Delivery in Regulated Environments
Proven delivery in government, utilities, and enterprise environments.
Compliance-aware architecture that meets the bar without over-engineering.

CASE STUDY A: Security Events → SMS Notifications
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[H2] Security Events → SMS Notifications
[Label] Independent architecture + build engagement
[Subtitle] Gallagher Command Centre ⇄ Telstra Messaging API

[H3] The Problem
The client's physical security platform (Gallagher Command Centre) generates
critical events — door forced, access denied, alarm triggered — but has no
native SMS notification capability. Operators needed real-time alerts on mobile,
with filtering to prevent alert fatigue.

[H3] The Approach
Designed and built an event-driven middleware bridge. The system polls
Gallagher's REST API over mutual TLS, processes and deduplicates events through
a rules engine, composes human-readable messages, and delivers via Telstra's
Messaging API v3.

[Architecture Diagram — described textually]
Flow: Gallagher Command Centre (Security Event Source)
  → HTTPS / mTLS Event Polling →
  Bridge (Event Processor)
    • Event Processing
    • Deduplication
    • Filtering Rules
    • Audit Logging
  → OAuth2 / REST SMS Delivery →
  Telstra Messaging API v3 (SMS Delivery)
  Bridge also connects to:
  Operator Dashboard (Monitoring & Configuration, Certificate Management)

[H3] Security
All communication uses TLS 1.2+. Gallagher API access is authenticated via
mutual TLS client certificates. Telstra API uses OAuth2 bearer tokens with
automatic refresh. API keys are hashed with PBKDF2 and stored with AES-256
encryption. The system handles minimal personal data — event metadata only, no
PII in transit.

[H3] Outcomes
Delivered working middleware with an operator dashboard, certificate management,
and comprehensive audit logging. Zero-touch deployment capability for
non-technical operators. Deployment pending customer rollout.

[H3] Extensibility
Architecture supports additional notification channels (email, Teams webhooks),
configurable filtering rules, and multi-tenant deployment. Rate limiting and
message queuing are built in.

CASE STUDY B: Structured Intake Automation

[H2] Structured Intake Automation
[Label] Product development — own IP
[Subtitle] PDF → Digital Workflow Pipeline

[H3] The Problem
Clinicians were spending significant time manually transcribing standardised
assessment forms from paper and PDF into digital records. The process was
error-prone and created workflow bottlenecks.

[H3] The Approach
Built a three-stage pipeline: PDF analysis extracts structured data into a
canonical schema, which then generates interactive digital forms with real-time
scoring and validation. The canonical model decouples the source format from the
rendering engine, enabling rapid onboarding of new assessment instruments.

[H3] Outcomes
Platform supports multiple assessment types with automated scoring.
Clinician-facing interface designed with neurodivergent-first UX principles.
Active development — own IP.

[Footer label] Product development — own IP.

[H1] About

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION: Professional Bio
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm an automation and integration architect based in Brisbane, Australia, with
over 20 years of experience across government, utilities, and enterprise
environments.

My work focuses on the space between systems — building secure, event-driven
integrations that connect platforms reliably and pass security review. I've
delivered across the M365 ecosystem, API development, information governance,
and cloud infrastructure.

I now operate as an independent practice — Move to Digital — taking on
architecture and delivery engagements, and building my own software products.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION: How I Work (4-step process)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[H2] How I Work

Step 1: Discovery
Understanding the problem, the constraints, and the people involved.

Step 2: Architecture
Designing the solution with security, maintainability, and handover in mind.

Step 3: Build
Iterative delivery with regular checkpoints. No surprises.

Step 4: Handover
Documentation, runbooks, and knowledge transfer. You own it completely.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION: Principles
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[H2] Principles

- Every engagement includes documentation and runbooks. If I build it, you can
  maintain it.
- Security review is part of the architecture, not a gate at the end.
- AI-assisted development where it adds genuine value, not as a talking point.
